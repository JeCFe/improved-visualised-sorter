# Improved visualised sorting

In 2021 I had completed a project of creating a visual sorting in React JavaScript, this was my first React project. This project has been rebuilt in Next / React TypeScript, where the legacy code has been refactored and converted over to TypeScript and better coding practices have been implemented.

This project can be viewed on: https://jecfe.github.io/improved-visualised-sorter/
